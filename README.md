# AdaBlueConnection
This is a simple little class for handling the Adafruit Bluefruit nRF8001 bluetooth device.
I found it hard to find a simple tutorial or example on how to easy connect to the device with swift 2 so I made
this class. A lot of code comes from this bigger project: https://github.com/adafruit/Bluefruit_LE_Connect

Its is compatible with xcode 7.0 beta and swift 2.0.
